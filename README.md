## Cabo player
This project is based on the card game of [Cabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_(game)).  

It is supposed to simulate a run of the game, just to see what the optimal player cards are and possibly even develop strategies. It has no end goal, but to play the game. I will try to think of and implement different strategies when I finish up the actual code.   


<sub>This is definitely not me trying to get a competitive edge when at parties....</sub>
